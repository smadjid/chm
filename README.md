**Hypervideo** is _video-centric hypermedia_ that offers a deep integration of audiovisual material in heterogeneous multimedia documents allowing many interesting audiovisual experiences. The purpose of the CHM project is to introduce hypervideo as a new domain, providing a data model that formally describes such documents and their behaviors besides the conventional hypermedia/multimedia ones.

The **CHM Project** had two main goals:
* To develop a formal model for hypervideo documents and
* To offer a practical framework that allows the design of Web oriented hypervideos.

[CHM](https://advene.org/chm) was a sub-project of the [Advene Project](https://advene.org)
