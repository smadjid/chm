      <h2><a href="subtitles.html" id="Subtitles">Video Subtitles</a></h2>
      <p>This sample shows a usual case of textual subtiting consisting in the transcription of the video speech, displayed in a synchronized way with the video. </p>

      <h2><a href="timeline.html" id="Timeline">Timeline</a></h2>
      <p>This example shows the use of a hypervideo timeline to show  meaningful events and features of the hypervideo story in a graphical manner.</p>

      <h2><a href="toc.html" id="Toc">Table of Content</a></h2>
      <p>The use of hypervideo tables of content is shown in this sample to give direct access to parts of the video, as can be found in all classical ToCs.</p>

      <h2><a href="map.html" id="Map">Map</a></h2>
      <p>In this sample, a graphical index denoted by a map component is used as a shortcut into parts of the hypervideo story.<p>

        <h2><a href="enrichment.html" id="Enrichment">Enrichment</a></h2>
      <p>The enrichments are components that enrich the information rendered by the video player by means of graphical and textual content.</p>

      <h2><a href="twoplayers.html" id="twoplayers">Two Independant Players</a></h2>
      <p>A hypervideo may consist in different sub-documents. Each sub-document constitutes a hypervideo and may be temporally independent from the other sub-documents. This sample shows two hypervideos, each one containing some particular features. The running of each one is independent from the other.</p>
<!--
      <h2><a href="twoplayers2.html" id="twoplayers2">Related Hypervideos</a></h2>
      <p>This sample shows a case when a hypervideo depends on another one. A master/slave relation is presented.</p>

<h2><a href="Tim.html" id="tim_hypervideo">The Tim Berners-Lee Talk sample</a></h2>
      <p>This last sample shows how hypervideo can be created in order to provide more insights into the content of the Tim Berners-Lee talk through an augmented and interactive video-based presentation. Many hypervideo reading and rendering components are used to more deeply explore the content of the video.</p>

      <h2><a href="nosferatu.html" id="Nosferatu_hypervideo">The Nosferatu Hypervideo sample</a></h2>
      <p>This last sample shows many hypervideo visualization artifacts to more deeply explore  how a hypervideo may help in the analysis and understanding of a video.</p>
